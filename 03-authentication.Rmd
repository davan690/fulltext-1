# Authentication {#authentication}

Some data sources require authentication. Here's a breakdown of how to do authentication by data source:

* **BMC**: BMC is integrated into Springer Publishers now, 
and that API requires an API key.  Get your key by signing up at 
<https://dev.springer.com/>, then you'll get a key. Pass the key to a 
named parameter `key` to `bmcopts`. Or, save your key in your `.Renviron` 
file as `SPRINGER_KEY`, and we'll read it in for you, and you don't 
have to pass in anything.
* **Scopus**: Scopus requires an API key to search their service. Go to 
<https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html>, register for an account, 
then when you're in your account, create an API key. Pass in as variable 
`key` to `scopusopts`, or store your key under the name 
`ELSEVIER_SCOPUS_KEY` as an environment variable in `.Renviron`, and 
we'll read it in for you. See `?Startup` in R for help.
* **Microsoft**: Get a key by creating an Azure account at 
<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions>, 
then requesting a key for **Academic Knowledge API** within 
**Cognitive Services**. Store it as an environment variable in your 
`.Renviron` file - see [Startup] for help. Pass your 
API key into `maopts` as a named element in a list like 
`list(key = Sys.getenv('MICROSOFT_ACADEMIC_KEY'))`
* **Crossref**: Crossref encourages requests with contact information 
(an email address) and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster 
for improved performance when you share your email address with them.
<https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service>
To pass your email address to Crossref via this client, store it 
as an environment variable in `.Renviron` like `crossref_email = name@example.com`
* **Entrez**: NCBI limits users to making only 3 requests per second. But, users
who register for an API key are able to make up to ten requests per second.
Getting a key is simple; register for a "my ncbi" account then click on a
button in the account settings page. Once you have an API key, you can pass it
as the argument `api_key` to `entrezopts` in both [ft_get()] and [ft_search()].
However, we advise you use environment variables instead as they are more secure.
To do that you can set an environment variable for the current R session like
`Sys.setenv(ENTREZ_KEY="yourkey")` OR better yet set it in your `.Renviron`
or equivalent file with an entry like `ENTREZ_KEY=yourkey` so that it is
used across R sessions.
